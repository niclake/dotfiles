# Nic Lake's Dotfiles

This repo contains the dotfiles that I utilize on all of my Mac machines. I've established this to make it easy to transition from machine to machine.

### Instructions

1. Clone into `~`
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Run `brew bundle install`

### zsh vs. bash

As of 2019, MacOS now utilizes `zsh` as its primary shell. I've left my `bash` config files here in case I need it (current as of March 2021), but have made the switch over to using `zsh` using [ScriptingOSX's guide](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/).

### Sublime Text Package List
